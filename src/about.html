                Hello Everyone! I am known as Azu, Azumy, Vicky, and many other names. I am 
                an adult, (or at least trying my best to be one...) And I have been on the 
                internet most of my life. Mostly chronically online. I am not very great when it
                comes to talking about myself, or just socializing in general but I will give it a try.</p>
      
                <p>I am mostly an artist. Painting, drawing, sculpting and different art forms have 
                  always intrigued me. Living off my art has always been an aspiration I hope I am 
                  able to achieve during my lifetime, but it's been increasingly difficult thanks to... Well, life. </p>
      
                <p>I was born in Venezuela back in the 90's when there were famous TV show's. (ha) And 
                  lived there until I was around 23 years old. During my time living in Venezuela, I had different
                  hardships. Not only at home but situations the country was facing as a whole. As a kid I became increasingly
                  critical of my work. Believe it or not, I used to share all my drawings to the internet, but became bitter and 
                  deleted everything, or at least mostly. And vowed to not post my works online.</p>
      
                <p>Despite this, I still worked mostly to myself and kept to myself online. I've been part of the furry community
                since very young, and I've been drawing animals since I was a little kid. I am now living in Spain since a couple of
                years ago. I want to start working again on my art, on getting better (emotionally and physically) and working on 
                living the life I genuenly want to live.
                </p>
